An object implementing this interface has the ability to generate a hash to
represent its value and allows it to be used as key in a hash table.

It's an alternative to `spl_object_hash()` and `spl_object_id()`, which
determines an object's hash/id based on its
handle: this means that two objects that are considered equal by an implicit
definition would not be treated as equal because they are not the same instance.

## Implements

### hashCode

Returns a hash code value for the object.

Signature: `hashCode(): int`

This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided
by a HashMap.

The general contract of hashCode is:

- Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution
  of an application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same
  integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is
  modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
  application to another execution of the same application.
- If two objects are equal according to the `\Par\Core\Equable::equals()`
  method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must
  produce the same integer result.
- It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the
  `\Par\Core\Equable::equals()` method, then calling the hashCode method on each
  of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the
  programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal
  objects may improve the performance of hash tables.

An implementation would be:

```
public function hashCode(): int
{
    return \Par\Core\Values::hash($this->x, $this->y, $this->z);
}
```
